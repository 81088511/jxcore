              "desc": "<pre><code>&gt; jx install [-g] name_of_the_package[@version]</code></pre>\n<p>Downloads npm package specified by <code>name_of_the_package</code>. If this package exists in JXcore repository, it will be downloaded as single .jx file.\nOtherwise the nmp tool will be employed to install required package as a regular npm module.\n\n</p>\n<p><code>-g</code> - enables global installation, the same as npm tool does. In fact, this switch is available only for npm packages:\neven if the package would be available on JXcore repository, it will not be installed when you use <code>-g</code> switch.\nInstead the package will be installed from the npm repository.\n\n</p>\n<p>Let’s discuss the following example: we would like to install the <a href=\"https://github.com/visionmedia/express\">express</a> module.\n\n</p>\n<pre><code>&gt; jx install express</code></pre>\n<p>Because this package is also available in JXcore repository, the command will just download a single file <em>express.jx</em> to the current folder.\nNow this package is ready to be used inside of your application:\n\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js\">var express = require(&quot;./express.jx&quot;);</code></pre>\n<p>In case if you would like to install different <code>version</code> of this package, you can type:\n\n</p>\n<pre><code>&gt; jx install express@3.3.3</code></pre>\n<p>Since this version (3.3.3) is not present in JXcore repository, the command will first download <em>npm.jx</em> file\n(which is in fact the npm tool packed into the jx file), and will try to use it to download the required version of the express package.\nNow you can use it like any other npm module:\n\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js\">var express = require(&quot;express&quot;);</code></pre>\n<p>Please note that you don’t need to have the npm tool installed on your machine. JXcore will download it to the current local folder when needed. Once downloaded it can be used like npm.\nFor example, instead of:\n\n</p>\n<pre><code>&gt; npm install -g express</code></pre>\n<p>You can do the same by:\n\n</p>\n<pre><code>&gt; jx npm.jx install -g express</code></pre>\n<p>In fact, any npm’s command can be passed this way:\n\n</p>\n<pre><code>&gt; jx npm.jx ls\n&gt; jx npm.jx uninstall express\netc.</code></pre>\n",
