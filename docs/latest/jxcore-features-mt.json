Each thread executes the code independently.\n\n</p>\n<p>JXcore by default will create 2 threads in the pool for that application, however you can change this value by supplying desired <code>number</code> of threads after the colon, like:\n\n</p>\n<pre><code>jx mt:4 file.js</code></pre>\n<p>It this case four threads will be created.\n\n</p>\n<p>Using the <code>mt</code> command suits the best, if your code does not execute any delayed or async jobs, otherwise the application may exit, before those jobs will have chance to complete.\n\n</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s consider the following example (<em>test.js</em>):\n\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js\">setTimeout(function() {\n    console.log(&quot;I&#39;m here after 20 secs.&quot;);\n}, 20000);\n\nconsole.log(&quot;I&#39;m here immediately.&quot;);</code></pre>\n<p>When we&#39;ll run it with:\n\n</p>\n<pre><code>jx mt test.js</code></pre>\n<p>the process will not last for 20 seconds, because it will end after the last line of the code executes. Too keep the process alive and waiting for any delayed tasks, you can use <code>mt-keep</code> command.\n\n</p>\n"

It means, that the whole application won&#39;t exit, unless you call <a href=\"jxcore-process.html#jxcore_process_process_release\"><code>process.release()</code></a> for each thread.\n\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js\">var delay = 1000 * (process.threadId + 1 );\n\nsetTimeout(function () {\n    console.log(&quot;I&#39;m here after &quot; + (delay / 1000) +\n        &quot; secs.
