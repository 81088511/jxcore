Each thread executes the code independently.\n\n</p>\n<p>JXcore by default will create 2 threads in the pool for that application, however you can change this value by supplying desired <code>number</code> of threads after the colon, like:\n\n</p>\n<pre><code>&gt; jx mt:4 file.js</code></pre>\n<p>It this case four threads will be created.\n\n</p>\n<p>Using the <code>mt</code> command suits the best, when your code does not execute any delayed or async jobs,\notherwise the application may exit, before those jobs will have chance to complete.\n\n</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s consider the following example (<em>test.js</em>):\n\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js\">setTimeout(function() {\n    console.log(&quot;I&#39;m here after 20 secs.&quot;);\n}, 20000);\n\nconsole.log(&quot;I&#39;m here immediately.&quot;);</code></pre>\n<p>When we&#39;ll run it with:\n\n</p>\n<pre><code>&gt; jx mt test.js</code></pre>\n<p>the process will not last for 20 seconds, because it will end after the last line of the code executes.\n\n</p>\n<p>To keep the process alive and waiting for any delayed tasks, you have two options:\n\n</p>\n<p>1) call <a href=\"jxcore-process.html#jxcore_process_process_keepalive_timeout\"><code>process.keepAlive()</code></a> in the code above (but then at some point also <a href=\"jxcore-process.html#jxcore_process_process_release\"><code>process.release()</code></a> if you want to release the application&#39;s process), like:\n\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js\">process.keepAlive();\n\nsetTimeout(function() {\n    console.log(&quot;I&#39;m here after 20 secs.&quot;);\n    process.release();\n}, 20000);\n\nconsole.log(&quot;I&#39;m here immediately.&quot;);</code></pre>\n<p>2) or run the code with <code>mt-keep</code> command.\n\n</p>\n"
